                Method: The smallest element is selected from the unsorted array and swapped with the leftmost element, 
                and that element becomes a part of the sorted array. This process continues moving unsorted array 
                boundary by one element to the right.

                NOTE: This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst case complexities 
                are of ÎŸ(n2), where n is the number of items.
